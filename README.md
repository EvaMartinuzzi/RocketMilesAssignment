### Assignment:
1. Write as many tests with asserts as possible to test the search functionality on rocketmiles.com
3. Add tests for login/creating account functionality
4. Using Facebook Graph Api as an example write script(s) to test a few of their endpoints of your choice. 

### Evaluation Criteria
* Code cleanliness
* Test structure
* Correctness
* Ability to run solution
* Coverage

### Tech Stack:
I personally used Maven, Chromedriver, IntelliJ, Selenium, and Java 10 to create these test cases.  Most of these were updated or downloaded at the most recent version as of the first week of July 2019.

Maven download: https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi

Chromedriver download:  https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=75.0.3770.90/

IntelliJ download: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/

Selenium download: http://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=3.141/ (download both the 3.141.59 zip and jar)

Java Download: https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-javase10-4425482.html (I used 10.0.1, this is not the latest possible version of Java to run)


### Instructions to run solution:

1. ```git clone git@github.com:EvaMartinuzzi/RocketMilesAssignment.git``` into the file of your choosing
2. In your terminal of choice, cd into this repository and run ```mvn clean install``` just to ensure there are no issues with maven
3. Open module in IntelliJ
4. Right click on the module and select "Run All Tests"
5. PLEASE NOTE:  all of these tests should pass.  I had some trouble with tests running too fast/too slow which caused errors, but if this happens please attempt to re run the test.  Thank you!
